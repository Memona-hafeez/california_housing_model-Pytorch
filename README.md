##California Housing Classification using PyTorch##


Overview


This project focuses on building a classification model using the California Housing dataset and PyTorch. The goal is to classify housing data based on specific attributes such as median income, location, and other key factors.

Objectives
1. Preprocess the California Housing dataset.
2. Build a neural network classifier using PyTorch.
3. Train the model using various housing features as inputs.
4. Evaluate model performance and save the trained model.
5. Visualize the results of the classification.
Steps Involved
1. Data Preprocessing
Dataset Used: California Housing dataset, which includes features like median house value, median income, population, etc.
Data Cleaning: Handled missing values, normalized the dataset, and converted it to PyTorch tensors for training.
Train-Test Split: The dataset was split into training and testing sets to evaluate the model performance.
2. Model Building
Model Architecture: A simple feed-forward neural network (FFNN) with fully connected layers was implemented using PyTorch.
Activation Function: ReLU activation was used for non-linearity, and the output layer used Softmax for classification.
Loss Function: Cross-entropy loss was chosen for classification.
Optimizer: Adam optimizer was used for weight updates.
3. Model Training
Training Process: The model was trained on the training dataset for a defined number of epochs, adjusting the weights based on the loss function.
Batch Processing: The data was processed in batches to improve the efficiency of training.
4. Model Evaluation
Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score were calculated to assess model performance.
Visualization: Both the actual and predicted classifications were visualized to compare the results.
5. Model Saving and Download
The trained model was saved as california_housing_model.pth for future use.
Provided code to download the saved model locally.

Conclusion
In this project, I applied classification techniques to the California Housing dataset using PyTorch. This helped me understand how to structure a neural network and handle real-world housing data. The results were visualized to show the classification performance, and the trained model was saved for future applications.
